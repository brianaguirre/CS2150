#HASHES:
	##Seperate Chaining:
		~When there are collisions within a hash table, you could do two things in order to solve the problem: 1. Seperate Chaining

		~Creates a "bucket" (actually a linked list) that stores the values that were filed at the same location.
			NOTE: Within the worst case scenario, the running time for hash tables is linear; everything hashes to the same bucket.

		 Analysis to Find:
		 	/Load Factor lambda/ - Number of elements divided by the table size. (Ratio)

		 	**The lower the load factor, the bigger the hash table is, thus there is more memory, but has fewer collisions (there are more locations). The opposite is true given the change in values.
		 		IMPORTANT QUESTION:	How do you find the balance?

		 	NOTE: Hash tables can almost achieve constant running time, conidering that if you have at most 5 elements within any location, then at most, the running time is roughly the constant of theta(5). Obviously, this is not really the case, since we can never know that each location has at most 5 elements, it is not guaranteed.


		 	For seperate chaining:


	##Open Addressing:
		~Disavantage of double hashing, you need to find 2 hash functions, both fast, evenly distribute, etc., which can be difficult.

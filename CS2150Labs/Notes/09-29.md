#Little Oh, Big Oh Stuff


##Little Oh
	Big 0 is an upper bound s.t. f(n) <= O(g(n));
	This means that Big O is an upper bound and possibly a maxima, thus a suprema of f(n)

	Little O is STRICTLY an uppr bound:
	Definition:
		f(n) < O(g(n));

##Big Theta:
	It's an approximation of f(n), which in fact is more useful (as we get to see how long the program usually runs).

	Notice that Big Theta is actually the combination of Omega and Big O, meaning f(n) is strickly bigger than Omega and less than or equal to O.

	There is not such thing as little theta.

##Set Syntax:
	Notice that f(n) = O(g(n)) implies equality, WE DO NOT CONSIDER THE SETS EQUAL, we say that the set f(n) is in O(g(n)), meaning it exists but the members are not the same.
	To mkae sure this is correct we say f(n) E O(g(n));

## Properties of O(g) Omega(g) and Theta(g)
	given fEO then gEOmega(g);
	Adding: O(f+g) = O(max(f,g))
	Transitive: fEO(g) and gEO(g) then fEO(h)
	Reflexive: fETheta(f), O and Omega as well.
	Symmetric: if fETheta(g) and gETheta(f)


##Classification of Functions:
	fE Theta(g(n)), given g, then we can deduce what function f is, if g = log(n), then f is logarithmic, g=n, then f is linear, g=n*log(n), f is log-linear.

	Notice that n^k E Theta(c^n) for any k>0 and c>1
	Notice that k is a constant greater than 0, n is the counting numbers.


#TREES:
	##Terminology:
	Root
	Leaf
	Siblings
	Height - Longest path to leaf, all leaves have height of 0. 
	Depth - length of path form root to the node
